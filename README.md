## About this project
As a means of communication, language plays an important role in human life. this also applies to students who are learning about Arabic. Meanwhile, the media participates in communication. In other words, the media plays an active role in enhancing learning and achieving student goals, which greatly determines the success and efficiency of education delivery. The presence of the media is a very important aspect in supporting the success of the learning process. In learning a language, vocabulary is very important. One thing that must be understood is that teaching vocabulary has the aim of expanding the learner's vocabulary.

This project aims to develop an object recognition mobile application to support students learning Arabic. The application is designed to help students improve their Arabic vocabulary by providing them with a fun and interactive way to learn new words. The application will use machine learning technology to recognize objects and translate their names into Arabic. By using this application, students will be able to easily and quickly expand their Arabic vocabulary. The success of this project will greatly enhance the efficiency of Arabic language education and improve students learning outcomes.
